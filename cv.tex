\section{The heat capacity}

The heat capacity $C_v/V$ was calculated as a function of temperature for Ar, Ne, Kr and Xe and plotted which is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:heat}. As we can see in the figure the heat capacity reaches a high temperature limit. That is, a limit where the heat capacity is independent of temperature. This is predicted by the Dulong-Petit law

\begin{equation*}
  C_V = M k_B
\end{equation*}

where $M$ is the total degrees of freedom and $k_B$ is the boltzmann constant.
